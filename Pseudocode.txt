The computer chooses a random number between 1 to 100.
User inputs N. 
If N is higher than 100, it shows Error.
If N is lower than 100,
    then if it's lower than computer number, 
        then computer says my number is higher than your guess, guess again higher!
    then if it's higher than computer number, 
        then computer says my number is lower than your guess, guess again lower!
    then if it's the computer number, 
        then computer says you are correct - the random number is computer number - end game!
